  NB. DecorativeSprites are not used in vanilla (currently) but they are available for modders.

  DecorativeSprites can be overwritten in item prefabs using <UpgradeOverride> tag. Example:

  <Item identifier="E">
    ...
    <UpgradeOverride identifier="increasewallhealth">
      <DecorativeSprite texture="Content/Items/InventoryIconAtlas.png" sourcerect="0,0,64,64" depth="0.75" origin="0.5,0.5"/>
    </UpgradeOverride>
    ...
  </Item>

  <Sprite> element defines the sprite that is shown in the store interface while <DecorativeSprites> are
  rendered on the item the upgrade is applied to.

  Decorative sprites support conditionals so different items can have different sprites

  <DecorativeSprite texture="Content/Items/InventoryIconAtlas.png" sourcerect="0,0,64,64" depth="0.75" origin="0.5,0.5" >
    <IsActiveConditional hastag="eq junctionbox"/>
  </DecorativeSprite>

  <DecorativeSprite texture="Content/Items/InventoryIconAtlas.png" sourcerect="64,0,64,64" depth="0.75" origin="0.5,0.5" >
    <IsActiveConditional hastag="eq reactor"/>
  </DecorativeSprite>

  The <Price> element takes 3 attributes, BasePrice, IncreaseLow and IncreaseHigh. Both IncreaseLow and IncreaseHigh
  should be a percentage and IncreaseHigh should always be more than IncreaseLow.

  The price is increased by lerping from IncreaseLow to IncreaseHigh depending on the level, so say you have max level of
  10 and IncreaseLow of 10% and IncreaseHigh of 20% then first upgrade level will increase the price by 10%, level 5 will
  increase by 15% and the last level will increase by 20%.

  If you are a modder and are reading this and want to add your own item to already existing upgrade category you can add
  allowedupgrades="XXX" attribute to your item where XXX corresponds to an upgrade category identifier, see how legacy pump does it.

  Upgrade modules can have both name="" and description="" attributes but they are not used in vanilla because of localization.

  Upgrade categories take items="" attribute which match either a tag or an identifier of an item. If wallupgrade="true"
  is specified instead of items the upgrade will target all hulls on the submarine.

  Overriding upgrade modules is supported the usual way however upgrade categories CANNOT be overridden because why would you? 
  if you have a valid reason why you would want to override categories submit an issue report on GitHub. 
  You can define your own categories though in the same file you define upgrade modules.
